I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology advised by Prof. [Ren Wang](https://wangren09.github.io/). 

I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Hangzhou Normal University under the supervision by Prof. Libing Hong and Prof. Shuchang Xu. I received my M.Eng. degrees in Computer Technology from Soochow University. I am fortunate to have been advised by Prof. [Jingya Zhou](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jy_zhou/index.html) on my research about social network analysis.


My research centers on `Trustworthy Machine Learning`.
