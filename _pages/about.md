I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. [Ren Wang](https://wangren09.github.io/). 

Before that, I received my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Technology from Soochow University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jingya Zhou](https://web.suda.edu.cn/jy_zhou/index.html) in the field of social network analysis.



My current research interests include
- Machine Unlearning
- Hypergraph-based Computational Biology
- Influence Analysis in Social Network
